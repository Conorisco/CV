# CV

My academic CV made with the `Vitae R` package, with code from a variety of github pages which I am indebted to. 

Rationale: Before discovering `Vitae` I had a CV written in Word. The word-based CV was created while I was still a teenager, probably appying for a lifeguard job. It had all these horrible formatting and anchors that made working with it like communing with a annoying comptuter poltergeist. 

I always wanted to learn LaTeX but never got round to it. I fell in love with `Rmarkdown` and was delighted when I found out it had LaTeX converter using a LaTeX template form `Vitae`. 

long form pdf CV available [here](https://github.com/Conorisco/CV/blob/main/CV_conorisco/CV_conorisco.pdf)
Short form pdf CV - TBC

Written in `rmarkdown` and exported using `tintex` to create LaTeX pdf 

Built using a bunch of excel files which hold raw data. I found this to be the most user friendly method to add new information. Other code examples added data within R, which I feel is not realistic way to read in new data. 

Built using a publication list exported from Mendeley desktop and using custom tables in excel.
