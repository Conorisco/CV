abstract = {Helminth products imprint long-term hematopoietic stem cells.Helminth-imprinted hematopoietic stem cells generate anti-inflammatory macrophages.Helminths attenuate autoimmunity by promoting anti-inflammatory trained immunity.Certain proinflammatory stimuli can metabolically and epigenetically modify monocytes/macrophages or NK cells to be more responsive to secondary stimuli, a process known as trained innate immunity. However, the longevity of trained innate immunity is unclear. In this study, we report that Fasciola hepatica excretory-secretory products (FHES) can imprint an anti-inflammatory phenotype on long-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and monocyte precursor populations, enhancing their proliferation and differentiation into anti-inflammatory Ly6Clow monocytes. These monocytes expand and populate multiple compartments within mice, conferring hyporesponsiveness to proinflammatory stimuli and reduced susceptibility to induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Mice treated with FHES had enhanced alternatively activated macrophages, reduced Th1 and Th17 responses, and attenuating effects on autoimmunity that persisted for 8 mo. Furthermore, transplantation of HSCs from FHES-treated mice transferred the anti-inflammatory phenotype to naive mice. Our findings demonstrate that helminth products can modulate HSCs to promote development of anti-inflammatory myeloid cells that attenuate T cell–mediated autoimmune disease.This article is featured in Top Reads, p.1407},

abstract = {Litomosoides sigmodontis is the only filarial nematode where the full life cycle, from larval delivery to the skin through to circulating microfilaria, can be completed in immunocompetent laboratory mice. It is thus an invaluable tool for the study of filariasis. It has been used for the study of novel anti-helminthic therapeutics, the development of vaccines against filariasis, the development of immunomodulatory drugs for the treatment of inflammatory disease and the study of basic immune responses to filarial nematodes. This review will focus on the latter and aims to summarize how the L sigmodontis model has advanced our basic understanding of immune responses to helminths, led to major discoveries in macrophage biology and provided new insights into the immunological functions of the pleural cavity. Finally, and most importantly L sigmodontis represents a suitable platform to study how host genotype affects immune responses, with the potential for further discovery in myeloid cell biology and beyond.},

abstract = {IL-33 is known to promote type 2 immune responses through ST2, a component of the IL-33R complex, expressed primarily on mast cells, Th2 cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells and regulatory T cells, and to a lesser extent, on NK cells and Th1 cells. Consistent with previous studies, we found that IL-33 polarized alternatively activated macrophages (AAM$\Phi$) in vivo. However, in vitro stimulation of murine bone marrow–derived or peritoneal macrophages with IL-33 failed to promote arginase activity or expression of YM-1 or Retnla, markers of AAM$\Phi$. Furthermore, macrophages have low/no basal expression of ST2. This suggested that alternative activation of macrophages may involve an IL-33–responsive third-party cell. Because mast cells have the highest expression of ST2 relative to other leukocytes, we focused on this cell type. Coculture experiments showed that IL-33–stimulated mast cells polarized AAM$\Phi$ through production of soluble factors. IL-33–stimulated mast cells produced a range of cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-13. Mast cell–derived IL-13 was required for induction of AAM$\Phi$, whereas mast cell–derived IL-6 enhanced macrophage responsiveness to IL-13 via upregulation of the IL-4R$\alpha$ receptor. Furthermore, we found that AAM$\Phi$ polarized by IL-33–stimulated mast cells could suppress proliferation and IL-17 and IFN-$\gamma$ production by T cells. Finally, we show that AAM$\Phi$ polarized by IL-33–stimulated mast cells attenuated the encephalitogenic function of T cells in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. Our findings reveal that IL-33 can promote immunosuppressive responses by polarizing AAM$\Phi$ via mast cell–derived IL-6 and IL-13.},

abstract = {Both TH2-dependent helminth killing and suppression of the TH2 effector response have been attributed to macrophages (M$\Phi$) activated by IL-4 (M(IL-4)). To investigate how M(IL-4) contribute to diverse infection outcomes, the M$\Phi$ compartment of susceptible BALB/c mice and more resistant C57BL/6 mice was profiled during infection of the pleural cavity with the filarial nematode, Litomosoides sigmodontis. C57BL/6 mice exhibited a profoundly expanded resident M$\Phi$ (resM$\Phi$) population, which was gradually replenished from the bone marrow in an age-dependent manner. Infection status did not alter the bone-marrow derived contribution to the resM$\Phi$ population, confirming local proliferation as the driver of resM$\Phi$ expansion. Significantly less resM$\Phi$ expansion was observed in the susceptible BALB/c strain, which instead exhibited an influx of monocytes that assumed an immunosuppressive PD-L2+ phenotype. Inhibition of monocyte recruitment enhanced nematode killing. Thus, the balance of monocytic vs. resident M(IL-4) numbers varies between inbred mouse strains and impacts infection outcome.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd There is evidence from epidemiology studies of a negative association between infection with helminth parasites and the development of allergy and asthma. Here, we demonstrate that the excretory/secretory products of the helminth Fasciola hepatica (FHES) protected mice against ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma when administered at time of allergen sensitization. FHES reduced the accumulation of mucus, eosinophils and lymphocytes into the airways of allergen-challenged mice. Furthermore, FHES treatment suppressed Th2 responses in the airways. Interestingly, systemic administration of FHES at allergen challenge had no effect on airway inflammation, demonstrating that alum-induced Th2 response is set following initial allergen sensitization. Our findings highlight the immunomodulatory potential of molecules secreted by F. hepatica.},

The molecular clock has a profound influence on innate immune function, and circadian disruption is linked with increased incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the mechanisms underlying this association are unknown. Here we show that BMAL1 and time-of-day regulate the accumulation and activation of various immune cells in a CNS autoimmune disease model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In myeloid cells, BMAL1 maintains anti-inflammatory responses and reduces T cell polarization. Loss of myeloid BMAL1 or midday immunizations to induce EAE create an inflammatory environment in the CNS through expansion and infiltration of IL-1$\beta$-secreting CD11b+Ly6Chi monocytes, resulting in increased pathogenic IL-17+/IFN-$\gamma$+ T cells. These findings demonstrate the importance of the molecular clock in modulating innate and adaptive immune crosstalk under autoimmune conditions.},

Here we examined the role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) adapter protein Mal in the control of B. pertussis infection in the lungs. We found that B. pertussis bacterial load in the lungs of Mal-defective (Mal(-/-)) mice exceeded that of wild-type (WT) mice by up to 100-fold and bacteria disseminated to the liver in Mal(-/-) mice and 50% of these mice died from the infection. Macrophages from Mal(-/-) mice were defective in an early burst of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and in their ability to kill or constrain intracellular growth of B. pertussis. Importantly, the B. pertussis bacterial load in the lungs inversely correlated with the number of alveolar macrophages. Despite the maintenance and expansion of other cell populations, alveolar macrophages were completely depleted from the lungs of infected Mal(-/-) mice, but not from infected WT mice. Our findings define for the first time a role for a microbial pattern-recognition pathway in the survival of alveolar macrophages and uncover a mechanism of macrophage-mediated immunity to B. pertussis in which Mal controls intracellular survival and dissemination of bacteria from the lungs.Mucosal Immunology advance online publication, 17 December 2014; doi:10.1038/mi.2014.125.},

abstract = {Helminth parasites are highly successful pathogens, chronically infecting a quarter of the world's population, causing significant morbidity but rarely causing death. Protective immunity and expulsion of helminths is mediated by T-helper 2 (Th2) cells, type 2 (M2) macrophages, type 2 innate lymphoid cells, and eosinophils. Failure to mount these type 2 immune responses can result in immunopathology mediated by Th1 or Th17 cells. Helminths have evolved a wide variety of approaches for immune suppression, especially the generation of regulatory T cells and anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-$\beta$. This is a very effective strategy for subverting protective immune responses to prolong their survival in the host but has the bystander effect of modulating immune responses to unrelated antigens. Epidemiological studies in humans have shown that infection with helminth parasites is associated with a low incidence of allergy/asthma and autoimmunity in developing countries. Experimental studies in mice have demonstrated that regulatory immune responses induced by helminth can suppress Th2 and Th1/Th17 responses that mediate allergy and autoimmunity, respectively. This has provided a rational explanation of the 'hygiene hypothesis' and has also led to the exploitation of helminths or their immunomodulatory products in the development of new immunosuppressive therapies for inflammatory diseases in humans.},
