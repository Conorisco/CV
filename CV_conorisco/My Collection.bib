abstract = {The recent revolution in tissue-resident macrophage biology has resulted largely from murine studies performed in C57BL/6 mice. Here, using both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, we analyze immune cells in the pleural cavity. Unlike C57BL/6 mice, naive tissue-resident large-cavity macrophages (LCMs) of BALB/c mice failed to fully implement the tissue-residency program. Following infection with a pleural-dwelling nematode, these pre-existing differences were accentuated with LCM expansion occurring in C57BL/6, but not in BALB/c mice. While infection drove monocyte recruitment in both strains, only in C57BL/6 mice were monocytes able to efficiently integrate into the resident pool. Monocyte-to-macrophage conversion required both T cells and interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4R$\alpha$) signaling. The transition to tissue residency altered macrophage function, and GATA6+ tissue-resident macrophages were required for host resistance to nematode infection. Therefore, during tissue nematode infection, T helper 2 (Th2) cells control the differentiation pathway of resident macrophages, which determines infection outcome.},

abstract = {Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are tissue-resident effector cells with roles in tissue homeostasis, protective immunity, and inflammatory disease. Group 3 ILCs (ILC3s) are classically defined by the master transcription factor ROR$\gamma$t. However, ILC3 can be further subdivided into subsets that share type 3 effector modules that exhibit significant ontological, transcriptional, phenotypic, and functional heterogeneity. Notably lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi)-like ILC3s mediate effector functions not typically associated with other ROR$\gamma$t-expressing lymphocytes, suggesting that additional transcription factors contribute to dictate ILC3 subset phenotypes. Here, we identify Bcl6 as a subset-defining transcription factor of LTi-like ILC3s in mice and humans. Deletion of Bcl6 results in dysregulation of the LTi-like ILC3 transcriptional program and markedly enhances expression of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and IL-17F in LTi-like ILC3s in a manner in part dependent upon the commensal microbiota—and associated with worsened inflammation in a model of colitis. Together, these findings redefine our understanding of ILC3 subset biology.},

abstract = {A rapid immune response to pathogen re-exposure underpins immunological memory, with protection against divergent pathogens such as heterologous or novel viral strains requiring cross­reactive memory T cells. Understanding the pathways that control memory T cell function is therefore important for the rational design of viral vaccines and will aid the discovery of therapies to boost anti-viral immunity. Here, we identify a sub-population of memory T cells that limit secondary immune responses to viral re-infection, which is crucial in preventing host tissue damage. We show that a population of CD4+ effector memory T (TEM) cells activate the important immunoregulatory cytokine TGF$\beta$, via expression of an integrin, $\alpha$v$\beta$8. Integrin $\alpha$v$\beta$8 expression marks a transcriptionally distinct sub-population of CD4+ TEM, enriched for anti-inflammatory pathways. Loss of integrin $\alpha$v$\beta$8 on murine CD4+ TEM, but not Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (TREG), led to exacerbated virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses following secondary influenza A virus (IAV) infection, which was associated with enhanced viral clearance. However, although accelerating clearance, loss of integrin $\alpha$v$\beta$8 expression on CD4+ TEM resulted in enhanced lung pathology following secondary IAV infection, which was completely reversed by adoptive transfer of $\alpha$v$\beta$8+ CD4+ TEM cells. These data highlight a new pathway by which a distinct CD4+ memory T cell subset restrains anti-viral immunity to prevent host tissue damage during secondary viral infection. Such pathways could be targeted therapeutically to either boost memory T-cell-mediated immunity or restrain host tissue damage during viral infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Certain proinflammatory stimuli can metabolically and epigenetically modify monocytes/macrophages or NK cells to be more responsive to secondary stimuli, a process known as trained innate immunity. However, the longevity of trained innate immunity is unclear. In this study, we report that Fasciola hepatica excretory-secretory products (FHES) can imprint an anti-inflammatory phenotype on long-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and monocyte precursor populations, enhancing their proliferation and differentiation into anti-inflammatory Ly6Clow monocytes. These monocytes expand and populate multiple compartments within mice, conferring hyporesponsiveness to proinflammatory stimuli and reduced susceptibility to induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Mice treated with FHES had enhanced alternatively activated macrophages, reduced Th1 and Th17 responses, and attenuating effects on autoimmunity that persisted for 8 mo. Furthermore, transplantation of HSCs from FHES-treated mice transferred the anti-inflammatory phenotype to naive mice. Our findings demonstrate that helminth products can modulate HSCs to promote development of anti-inflammatory myeloid cells that attenuate T cell–mediated autoimmune disease.},

It is thus an invaluable tool for the study of filariasis. It has been used for the study of novel anti-helminthic therapeutics, the development of vaccines against filariasis, the development of immunomodulatory drugs for the treatment of inflammatory disease and the study of basic immune responses to filarial nematodes. This review will focus on the latter and aims to summarize how the L sigmodontis model has advanced our basic understanding of immune responses to helminths, led to major discoveries in macrophage biology and provided new insights into the immunological functions of the pleural cavity. Finally, and most importantly L sigmodontis represents a suitable platform to study how host genotype affects immune responses, with the potential for further discovery in myeloid cell biology and beyond.},

abstract = {IL-33 is known to promote type 2 immune responses through ST2, a component of the IL-33R complex, expressed primarily on mast cells, Th2 cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells and regulatory T cells, and to a lesser extent, on NK cells and Th1 cells. Consistent with previous studies, we found that IL-33 polarized alternatively activated macrophages (AAM$\Phi$) in vivo. However, in vitro stimulation of murine bone marrow–derived or peritoneal macrophages with IL-33 failed to promote arginase activity or expression of YM-1 or Retnla, markers of AAM$\Phi$. Furthermore, macrophages have low/no basal expression of ST2. This suggested that alternative activation of macrophages may involve an IL-33–responsive third-party cell. Because mast cells have the highest expression of ST2 relative to other leukocytes, we focused on this cell type. Coculture experiments showed that IL-33–stimulated mast cells polarized AAM$\Phi$ through production of soluble factors. IL-33–stimulated mast cells produced a range of cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-13. Mast cell–derived IL-13 was required for induction of AAM$\Phi$, whereas mast cell–derived IL-6 enhanced macrophage responsiveness to IL-13 via upregulation of the IL-4R$\alpha$ receptor. Furthermore, we found that AAM$\Phi$ polarized by IL-33–stimulated mast cells could suppress proliferation and IL-17 and IFN-$\gamma$ production by T cells. Finally, we show that AAM$\Phi$ polarized by IL-33–stimulated mast cells attenuated the encephalitogenic function of T cells in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. Our findings reveal that IL-33 can promote immunosuppressive responses by polarizing AAM$\Phi$ via mast cell–derived IL-6 and IL-13.},

To investigate how M(IL-4) contribute to diverse infection outcomes, the M$\Phi$ compartment of susceptible BALB/c mice and more resistant C57BL/6 mice was profiled during infection of the pleural cavity with the filarial nematode, Litomosoides sigmodontis. C57BL/6 mice exhibited a profoundly expanded resident M$\Phi$ (resM$\Phi$) population, which was gradually replenished from the bone marrow in an age-dependent manner. Infection status did not alter the bone-marrow derived contribution to the resM$\Phi$ population, confirming local proliferation as the driver of resM$\Phi$ expansion. Significantly less resM$\Phi$ expansion was observed in the susceptible BALB/c strain, which instead exhibited an influx of monocytes that assumed an immunosuppressive PD-L2+ phenotype. Inhibition of monocyte recruitment enhanced nematode killing. Thus, the balance of monocytic vs. resident M(IL-4) numbers varies between inbred mouse strains and impacts infection outcome.},

Here we show that BMAL1 and time-of-day regulate the accumulation and activation of various immune cells in a CNS autoimmune disease model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In myeloid cells, BMAL1 maintains anti-inflammatory responses and reduces T cell polarization. Loss of myeloid BMAL1 or midday immunizations to induce EAE create an inflammatory environment in the CNS through expansion and infiltration of IL-1$\beta$-secreting CD11b + Ly6C hi monocytes, resulting in increased pathogenic IL-17 + /IFN-$\gamma$ + T cells.

abstract = {Epidemiologic studies in humans have demonstrated that infection with helminth parasites is associated with a reduced risk of developing autoimmune diseases. Mechanistic studies in mice have linked the protective effect of helminths on autoimmunity to the suppressive activity of helminth-induced regulatory T cells (Tregs) or Th2 cells. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of mice with Fasciola hepatica excretory-secretory products (FHES) attenuated the clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Protection was associated with a significant reduction in the infiltration of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells into the brain. Although FHES enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine and Th2 responses, protection against EAE was independent of IL-4, IL-10, and Tregs. However, administration of FHES induced production of the type 2 cytokines IL-33 and IL-5, which promoted accumulation of eosinophils. FHES-induced expansion of eosinophils and protection against EAE was lost in IL-33−/− mice and upon neutralization of IL-5. Furthermore, transfer of FHES-induced or IL-33–induced eosinophils conferred protection against EAE. In addition, treatment of mice with recombinant IL-33 attenuated autoimmunity, and this was dependent on IL-5. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report a role for helminth-induced IL-5 and IL-33 in protection against autoimmunity.},

Here we examined the role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) adapter protein Mal in the control of B. pertussis infection in the lungs. We found that B. pertussis bacterial load in the lungs of Mal-defective (Mal(-/-)) mice exceeded that of wild-type (WT) mice by up to 100-fold and bacteria disseminated to the liver in Mal(-/-) mice and 50% of these mice died from the infection. Macrophages from Mal(-/-) mice were defective in an early burst of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and in their ability to kill or constrain intracellular growth of B. pertussis. Importantly, the B. pertussis bacterial load in the lungs inversely correlated with the number of alveolar macrophages. Despite the maintenance and expansion of other cell populations, alveolar macrophages were completely depleted from the lungs of infected Mal(-/-) mice, but not from infected WT mice. Our findings define for the first time a role for a microbial pattern-recognition pathway in the survival of alveolar macrophages and uncover a mechanism of macrophage-mediated immunity to B. pertussis in which Mal controls intracellular survival and dissemination of bacteria from the lungs.},

abstract = {Helminth parasites are highly successful pathogens, chronically infecting a quarter of the world's population, causing significant morbidity but rarely causing death. Protective immunity and expulsion of helminths is mediated by T-helper 2 (Th2) cells, type 2 (M2) macrophages, type 2 innate lymphoid cells, and eosinophils. Failure to mount these type 2 immune responses can result in immunopathology mediated by Th1 or Th17 cells. Helminths have evolved a wide variety of approaches for immune suppression, especially the generation of regulatory T cells and anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-$\beta$. This is a very effective strategy for subverting protective immune responses to prolong their survival in the host but has the bystander effect of modulating immune responses to unrelated antigens. Epidemiological studies in humans have shown that infection with helminth parasites is associated with a low incidence of allergy/asthma and autoimmunity in developing countries. Experimental studies in mice have demonstrated that regulatory immune responses induced by helminth can suppress Th2 and Th1/Th17 responses that mediate allergy and autoimmunity, respectively. This has provided a rational explanation of the 'hygiene hypothesis' and has also led to the exploitation of helminths or their immunomodulatory products in the development of new immunosuppressive therapies for inflammatory diseases in humans.},

abstract = {The lower incidence of allergy and autoimmune diseases in developing countries has been associated with a high prevalence of parasitic infections. Here we provide direct experimental evidence that parasites can exert bystander immunosuppression of pathogenic T cells that mediate autoimmune diseases. Infection of mice with Fasciola hepatica resulted in recruitment of dendritic cells, macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, and CD4(+) T cells into the peritoneal cavity. The dendritic cells and macrophages in infected mice expressed IL-10 and latency-associated peptide, and they had low surface expression of costimulatory molecules and/or MHC class II. Furthermore, most CD4(+) T cells in the peritoneal cavity of infected mice secreted IL-10, but not IFN-gamma or IL-4. There was a less significant expansion of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T cells. F. hepatica-specific Tr1-type clones generated from infected mice suppressed proliferation and IFN-gamma production by Th1 cells. Infection was associated with suppression of parasite-specific Th1 and Th2 responses, which was reversed in IL-10-defective mice. Infection with F. hepatica also exerted bystander suppression of immune responses to autoantigens and attenuated the clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Protection was associated with suppression of autoantigen-specific IFN-gamma and IL-17 production. The suppression of Th1 and Th17 responses and attenuation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by F. hepatica was maintained in IL-10(-/-) mice but was reversed by neutralization of TGF-beta in vivo. Our study provides evidence that F. hepatica-induced IL-10 subverts parasite-specific Th1 and Th2 responses, but that F. hepatica-induced TGF-beta plays a critical role in bystander suppression of autoantigen-specific Th1 and Th17 responses that mediate autoimmune diseases.},
