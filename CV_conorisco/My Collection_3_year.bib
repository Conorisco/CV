abstract = {BACKGROUND Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common, debilitating skin disorder characterized by recurring episodes of raised, itchy and sometimes painful wheals lasting longer than 6 weeks. CSU is mediated by mast cells which are absent from peripheral blood. However, lineage-CD34hiCD117int/hiFceRI+ cells in blood have previously been shown to represent a mast cell precursor. METHODS We enumerated FceRI-, FceRI+ and FceRIhi lineage-CD34+CD117+ cells using flow cytometry in blood of patients with CSU (n = 55), including 12 patients receiving omalizumab and 43 not receiving omalizumab (n = 43). Twenty-two control samples were studied. Disease control and patient response to omalizumab was evaluated using the urticaria control test. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) on lineage-CD34hiCD117hi blood cells from a subset of patients with CSU (n = 8) and healthy controls (n = 4). RESULTS CSU patients had more lineage-CD34+CD117+FceRI+ blood cells than controls. Lineage-CD34+CD117+FceRI+ cells were significantly higher in patients with CSU who had an objective clinical response to omalizumab when compared to patients who had poor disease control 90 days after initiation of omalizumab. scRNA-Seq revealed that lineage-CD34+CD117+FceRI+ cells contained both lymphoid and myeloid progenitor lineages, with omalizumab responsive patients having proportionally more myeloid progenitors. The myeloid progenitor lineage contained small numbers of true mast cell precursors along with more immature FceRI- and FceRI+ myeloid progenitors. CONCLUSION Increased blood CD34+CD117+FceRI+ cells may reflect enhanced bone marrow egress in the setting of CSU. High expression of these cells strongly predicts better clinical responses to the anti-IgE therapy, omalizumab.},

abstract = {In mouse peritoneal and other serous cavities, the transcription factor GATA6 drives the identity of the major cavity resident population of macrophages, with a smaller subset of cavity-resident macrophages dependent on the transcription factor IRF4. Here we showed that GATA6+ macrophages in the human peritoneum were rare, regardless of age. Instead, more human peritoneal macrophages aligned with mouse CD206+ LYVE1+ cavity macrophages that represent a differentiation stage just preceding expression of GATA6. A low abundance of CD206+ macrophages was retained in C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet and in wild-captured mice, suggesting that differences between serous cavity-resident macrophages in humans and mice were not environmental. IRF4-dependent mouse serous cavity macrophages aligned closely with human CD1c+CD14+CD64+ peritoneal cells, which, in turn, resembled human peritoneal CD1c+CD14-CD64- cDC2. Thus, major populations of serous cavity-resident mononuclear phagocytes in humans and mice shared common features, but the proportions of different macrophage differentiation stages greatly differ between the two species, and dendritic cell (DC2)-like cells were especially prominent in humans.},

abstract = {The recent revolution in tissue-resident macrophage biology has resulted largely from murine studies performed in C57BL/6 mice. Here, using both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, we analyze immune cells in the pleural cavity. Unlike C57BL/6 mice, naive tissue-resident large-cavity macrophages (LCMs) of BALB/c mice failed to fully implement the tissue-residency program. Following infection with a pleural-dwelling nematode, these pre-existing differences were accentuated with LCM expansion occurring in C57BL/6, but not in BALB/c mice. While infection drove monocyte recruitment in both strains, only in C57BL/6 mice were monocytes able to efficiently integrate into the resident pool. Monocyte-to-macrophage conversion required both T cells and interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4R$\alpha$) signaling. The transition to tissue residency altered macrophage function, and GATA6+ tissue-resident macrophages were required for host resistance to nematode infection. Therefore, during tissue nematode infection, T helper 2 (Th2) cells control the differentiation pathway of resident macrophages, which determines infection outcome.},

abstract = {A rapid immune response to pathogen re-exposure underpins immunological memory, with protection against divergent pathogens such as heterologous or novel viral strains requiring cross­reactive memory T cells. Understanding the pathways that control memory T cell function is therefore important for the rational design of viral vaccines and will aid the discovery of therapies to boost anti-viral immunity. Here, we identify a sub-population of memory T cells that limit secondary immune responses to viral re-infection, which is crucial in preventing host tissue damage. We show that a population of CD4+ effector memory T (TEM) cells activate the important immunoregulatory cytokine TGF$\beta$, via expression of an integrin, $\alpha$v$\beta$8. Integrin $\alpha$v$\beta$8 expression marks a transcriptionally distinct sub-population of CD4+ TEM, enriched for anti-inflammatory pathways. Loss of integrin $\alpha$v$\beta$8 on murine CD4+ TEM, but not Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (TREG), led to exacerbated virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses following secondary influenza A virus (IAV) infection, which was associated with enhanced viral clearance. However, although accelerating clearance, loss of integrin $\alpha$v$\beta$8 expression on CD4+ TEM resulted in enhanced lung pathology following secondary IAV infection, which was completely reversed by adoptive transfer of $\alpha$v$\beta$8+ CD4+ TEM cells. These data highlight a new pathway by which a distinct CD4+ memory T cell subset restrains anti-viral immunity to prevent host tissue damage during secondary viral infection. Such pathways could be targeted therapeutically to either boost memory T-cell-mediated immunity or restrain host tissue damage during viral infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Group 3 ILCs (ILC3s) are classically defined by the master transcription factor ROR$\gamma$t. However, ILC3 can be further subdivided into subsets that share type 3 effector modules that exhibit significant ontological, transcriptional, phenotypic, and functional heterogeneity. Notably lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi)-like ILC3s mediate effector functions not typically associated with other ROR$\gamma$t-expressing lymphocytes, suggesting that additional transcription factors contribute to dictate ILC3 subset phenotypes. Here, we identify Bcl6 as a subset-defining transcription factor of LTi-like ILC3s in mice and humans. Deletion of Bcl6 results in dysregulation of the LTi-like ILC3 transcriptional program and markedly enhances expression of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and IL-17F in LTi-like ILC3s in a manner in part dependent upon the commensal microbiota-and associated with worsened inflammation in a model of colitis. Together, these findings redefine our understanding of ILC3 subset biology.},

abstract = {Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are guardians of mucosal immunity, yet the transcriptional networks that support their function remain poorly understood. We used inducible combinatorial deletion of key transcription factors (TFs) required for ILC development (ROR$\gamma$t, ROR$\alpha$ and T-bet) to determine their necessity in maintaining ILC3 identity and function. Both ROR$\gamma$t and ROR$\alpha$ were required to preserve optimum effector functions; however, ROR$\alpha$ was sufficient to support robust interleukin-22 production among the lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi)-like ILC3 subset, but not natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR)+ ILC3s. Lymphoid tissue inducer-like ILC3s persisted with only selective loss of phenotype and effector functions even after the loss of both TFs. In contrast, continued ROR$\gamma$t expression was essential to restrain transcriptional networks associated with type 1 immunity within NCR+ ILC3s, which coexpress T-bet. Full differentiation to an ILC1-like population required the additional loss of ROR$\alpha$. Together, these data demonstrate how TF networks integrate within mature ILCs after development to sustain effector functions, imprint phenotype and restrict alternative differentiation programs.},

However, the longevity of trained innate immunity is unclear. In this study, we report that Fasciola hepatica excretory-secretory products (FHES) can imprint an anti-inflammatory phenotype on long-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and monocyte precursor populations, enhancing their proliferation and differentiation into anti-inflammatory Ly6Clow monocytes. These monocytes expand and populate multiple compartments within mice, conferring hyporesponsiveness to proinflammatory stimuli and reduced susceptibility to induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Mice treated with FHES had enhanced alternatively activated macrophages, reduced Th1 and Th17 responses, and attenuating effects on autoimmunity that persisted for 8 mo. Furthermore, transplantation of HSCs from FHES-treated mice transferred the anti-inflammatory phenotype to naive mice. Our findings demonstrate that helminth products can modulate HSCs to promote development of anti-inflammatory myeloid cells that attenuate T cell-mediated autoimmune disease.},

This review will focus on the latter and aims to summarize how the L sigmodontis model has advanced our basic understanding of immune responses to helminths, led to major discoveries in macrophage biology and provided new insights into the immunological functions of the pleural cavity. Finally, and most importantly L sigmodontis represents a suitable platform to study how host genotype affects immune responses, with the potential for further discovery in myeloid cell biology and beyond.},

abstract = {IL-33 is known to promote type 2 immune responses through ST2, a component of the IL-33R complex, expressed primarily on mast cells, Th2 cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells and regulatory T cells, and to a lesser extent, on NK cells and Th1 cells. Consistent with previous studies, we found that IL-33 polarized alternatively activated macrophages (AAM$\Phi$) in vivo. However, in vitro stimulation of murine bone marrow-derived or peritoneal macrophages with IL-33 failed to promote arginase activity or expression of YM-1 or Retnla, markers of AAM$\Phi$. Furthermore, macrophages have low/no basal expression of ST2. This suggested that alternative activation of macrophages may involve an IL-33-responsive third-party cell. Because mast cells have the highest expression of ST2 relative to other leukocytes, we focused on this cell type. Coculture experiments showed that IL-33-stimulated mast cells polarized AAM$\Phi$ through production of soluble factors. IL-33-stimulated mast cells produced a range of cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-13. Mast cell-derived IL-13 was required for induction of AAM$\Phi$, whereas mast cell-derived IL-6 enhanced macrophage responsiveness to IL-13 via upregulation of the IL-4R$\alpha$ receptor. Furthermore, we found that AAM$\Phi$ polarized by IL-33-stimulated mast cells could suppress proliferation and IL-17 and IFN-$\gamma$ production by T cells. Finally, we show that AAM$\Phi$ polarized by IL-33-stimulated mast cells attenuated the encephalitogenic function of T cells in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. Our findings reveal that IL-33 can promote immunosuppressive responses by polarizing AAM$\Phi$ via mast cell-derived IL-6 and IL-13.},
