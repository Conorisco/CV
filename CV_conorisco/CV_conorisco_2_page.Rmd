<!-- # Career profile -->
<!-- I started my career in Trinity College Dublin identify pathways that shut down autoimmunity and allergy, leading to three papers in *The Journal of Immunology* and one in *Parasite immunology* and co-authorship in *Nature communications*. Next in Manchester I made a major advance on how adaptive immunity controls macrophages and how macrophage differentiation controls disease outcomes, publishing articles in *Immunity*, *elife*, *Nature Immunology* and *Parasite Immunology*. Recently, back in Ireland I have been conducting patient orientated research where I have submitted my first co-final author paper. I have received a best talk at the Irish Society of Immunology conference, been an invited speaker at 3 conferences and spoken at 13 more. I have received 8 awards. I have supervised 13 research students, reviewed articles, grants and will soon join *Frontiers in immunology* as a review editor. I am the member of 4 scientific societies, and sit on 3 committees. I am a co-inventor on a patent WM01-740-02 that has been commercialised as a biotech company Pravalix Tx.  -->

<!-- I am ready to educate the next generation of scientists and clinicians and lead my own group to make transformative discoveries. -->

<!-- # Snapshot -->
<!-- My main research interest is in what genetic factors control mononuclear phagocyte (macrophage) differentiation during inflammation on a single cell level and how this impacts on disease outcomes. I have expertise in single cell RNA-sequencing, NGS, cell biology, *in vitro* and *in vivo* sciences and summarising complex data through effective data visualisation. -->
